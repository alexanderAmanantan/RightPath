1. /config 
This folder holds your configuration files for things like your database connection, API keys, or other settings that might change depending on the environment (local, staging, production).

database.php: Database connection settings.
app.php: General application configuration like environment settings.

2. /controllers
Controllers handle the logic for processing requests and returning responses. You’ll have controllers to handle user-related requests, admin-related requests, etc. Each controller should be dedicated to a specific resource or functionality (e.g., authentication, users, posts).

UserController.php: Handles user-related logic (signup, login, profile).
AdminController.php: Admin-specific routes (dashboard, settings).
AuthController.php: Handles login, registration, and authentication logic.

3. /routes
The routes folder contains files that define your application’s API endpoints. You’ll have separate files for the user side and the admin side (since these will have different functionalities).

web.php: Public routes for the user-facing frontend (React app).
admin.php: Routes that handle admin-specific API requests.
In your main index.php (or server entry file), you would include these route files to set up the routing.

4. /middleware
Middleware handles things like authentication and authorization. For example, you can add middleware to ensure that only authenticated users can access certain routes.

AuthMiddleware.php: Check if a user is authenticated before accessing private routes.
AdminMiddleware.php: Ensure that only users with admin privileges can access admin routes.

5. /services
This folder can be used for logic related to external services, such as payment processors, email services, or third-party APIs.

EmailService.php: Logic for sending email notifications.
PaymentService.php: Handling interactions with payment gateways like Paymongo.

index.php (Main entry point)
This file would be your main application entry point. If you're using a PHP framework like Laravel, this would be handled by the framework's routing system, but if it's a simpler PHP setup, you'll need to set up routing here by including files from /routes, connecting to the database, etc.

some important notes:
1. CORS Configuration (if needed)
If your React app is on a different domain or port, you’ll need to enable CORS headers in each API file, or globally by adding this in db.php:
// Enable CORS
header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *");
header("Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, OPTIONS");
header("Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type");
